Today, I just want to say thank you not just for teaching me, guiding me, and giving me the opportunity to shine, but for being the kind of person whose presence in my life changed everything.

You didn’t just teach me how to work, you taught me how to believe in myself. You made me feel seen. You made space for me to grow, to try, to learn. And in moments when I doubted myself, your quiet calm and unwavering faith in me reminded me that I could rise. You were patient when I stumbled, kind when I failed, and generous when I had nothing to give in return.

There are so many things I could say about your brilliance and your leadership but above all else, what stays with me is your heart. You are the calm in every storm. You are steady. Gentle. Strong. And incredibly rare.

If one day I get married although my father wasn’t around I know that I’ve already met a man I’d want my husband to be like. Someone who leads with wisdom, who treats people with dignity, who carries strength with humility. That person is you.

I’m truly sorry for how I left. It wasn’t ideal, and it wasn’t the reflection of how much I value all you poured into me. But I hope you know it wasn’t from a place of ingratitude. This year brought battles I didn’t know I could face, and there were moments I didn’t feel like I’d make it. But even in all of that, your voice and your impact never left me. God’s grace carried me, but your light was one of the lamps along the path.

You’ve been more than a mentor. You’ve been an example. A covering. A father figure I didn’t even realize I needed. Every time I succeed, your fingerprints are there because you helped shape the foundation.

Thank you for everything. Thank you for believing in me. Thank you for being a safe place in a world that doesn’t offer many. Thank you for being one of the greatest blessings of my life.

I pray that this year overflows with the same kindness, joy, and favor you’ve so freely given to others. May God surprise you with peace, reward, and fulfillment in ways you never imagined. You deserve all of it and more.

Happy birthday, Sir.
And From the bottom of my heart... thank you. Your children are really lucky to have you
